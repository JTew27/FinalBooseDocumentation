    "summary": "Namespace JTEW_BOOSE Classes AppArray AppArray class used to define an integer or a double array that can be added to using poke and a value cna be taken from using peek. inherits the command interface so that the command format is used of set compile execute. Evaluation allows for the array to be saved after the command is executed aliging it with other classes AppBool creates and evalutates boolean variables that have been entered true or false inherits from evaluation so that the class can set up varibales t be stored in a variable list containing all types makes use of Icommand inteerface to format the class with the parser compiliation and execution AppCanvas new version of the canvas class that extends the Icanvas interface so that all the relevant drawing methods can be referenced and created that exist within so they can be overidden to implement my own version AppCircle Inherits BOOSE.CommandOneParameter meaning that this class expects and only takes one valid parameter so that it can be passed in to draw a circle Sets up the circle command and its parameter so a circle can be drawn with canvas AppClear allows for the bitmap to cleared to a blank slate AppCommandFactory This factory extends the command factory in boose so that the relevant methods can be used such as makeCommand to make a new custom instance of each drawing method AppDrawTo Inherits BOOSE.CommandTwoParameters so that two arguements are expected to be passed in so that a line can be drawn from the x coordinate parameter to the y coordinate AppElse Is ran when an else is found as part of an If else inherits from compoundCommand that makes use of conditional commmand used by all loops becasue a conditon needs to be evaluated to run a specifc part. ensures that commands are run in a specifc order and the program counter is updated AppEvaluation used in my parser to handle the use of expressions and evaluate any equations that are passed in as the value to return a final value AppIf if condition that will update variables to loop depending on what the condition returns inherits from compound command to use line numbers to allow for program counter to update to run commands in the correct order command interface is used for formatting/// AppInt Allows for storing and updating integer variables to a list so that they can be used in expressiosn and other commands inherots from the command interface to format the class witha set compile execute to run inherits from evaluation to essentially format any storage with a name and a value AppMoveTo Creates and calls the moveto command so that the pen is repositioned by the canvas passing an x and y coordinate to move the pen when it is executed. Inherits BOOSE.CommandTwoParameters meaning two parameters must be passed in for both coordinates so that they can be passed to canvas. AppPColour Sets the pen colour for drawing. Inherits from BOOSE.CommandThreeParameters so the number of parameters much match representing (RGB red,green,blue) AppParser AppPeek AppPoke allows for a value to be defined and added to an already exisitng array in a specifc location field AppReal creates double values so that they can be stored in app stored program variable list to be used for creating different drawing commands Inherits the Icommand interface to use the command format of set compilign and executing Inherits Evaluation so that values can be saved and set up correctly AppRect Inherits BOOSE.CommandTwoParameters so that two arguements are expected to be passed in so that a rectangle can be drawn from the width and height at the current x and y coordinate. AppStoredProgram AppTri AppWhile performs the while loop mkaing use of the command stack to execute in a specifc order AppWriteText Inherits BOOSE.CommandOneParameter meaning that this class expects and only takes one valid parameter so that it can be passed to write the text onto the bitmap Sets up the circle command and its parameter so a circle can be drawn with canvas BOOSE The main class that allows for the program to run BOOSE calling relevant interfaces connecting parser, command factory, stored program and drawing canvas.
